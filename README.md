# DEEP NEURAL DECISION FOREST
This is the code for the Deep Learning Project (2019). 
Emotion recognition has been intesively exploited in the most recent years, due to the low-cost technologies involved and the interest derived from different fields of research, like psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience and computer science in general. Even if the interest in the topic had been constantly growing, the available datasets are still a small number. For this research we decided to test our network on the RAVDESS dataset, which contains audio and video data coming from 24 authors who emulate different emotions.

Our problem is doing an audio emotion recognition using a particular kind of architecture: the deep random forest. This architecture has been tested on the MNIST dataset and on other image dataset while here we apply the network on audio data, which are converted in coefficient through an MFCC and then processed.
